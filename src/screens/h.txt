If I had the opportunity to do the ONGC intern again, I would improve upon the project in scalability and integration with CI/CD. My specific recommendations would be to:
Implement containerization with Docker for consistent and efficient deployment across different environments.
Utilize microservices architecture if the application is likely to grow. For example, separating user authentication, data processing, and reporting to serve each as its own service.
Implement automated testing and CI/CD pipelines to make deployments reliable and to provide quicker feedback on changes that have been made to code.
Improve security by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and performing more comprehensive input sanitization.
Implementing these suggestions would make the overall system production-ready, maintainable and resilient to further scaling.
